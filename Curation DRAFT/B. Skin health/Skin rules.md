## Smooth skin 
- Makeup Removal≠Cleansing
- Some of the best cleansers are sold on drugstore shelves, so look there first. 
- If you use heavy makeup, you have to remove it before cleansing. 
- Fingers are not enough and will never get skin really clean. 
- Use cotton pads or rounds or a fresh washcloth every time you wash your face. 
- Don’t scrub; just rub gently, particularly around the nose and on the neck. 
- Use lukewarm water, not hot or icy cold. 
- When skin is cleaner and more exfoliated, serums and treatment products penetrate better. 
- Never go to bed without cleansing your face. 
- If you don’t, the result will be clogged pores and breakouts.
- Don’t keep sunscreens from one year to another. 
- Use sunscreen and big hats to protect your face. Walk on the shady side of the street.
- Use a sunscreen with SPF 30 daily.
- Skin changes with the seasons and with the years, and skin care should change, too.
    - A cleansing routine that works in winter may not work so well in summer. 
    - What worked for you a couple of years ago may no longer be effective because of age or changes in hormone levels reflected in your skin. 
- Tinted moisturizers make people look more youthful and glowing.
    For everyday use, a moisturizer—tinted or not—with an SPF of 30 is ideal. 
        Stila Sheer Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30
        Josie Maran Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30
        Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF 30
        Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30
        Lancôme Bienfait Multi-vital SPF 30
    If you have oily skin:

- Fake eyelashes of any sort, including lash extensions, are a terrible idea. 
    - The glue damages the delicate skin of the eyelid and pulls out eyelashes, often permanently.
    - Dyeing your lashes is an even worse idea and is illegal in many states for good reason, since the dye can severely damage the eye and even cause blindness. 
        A new process, called Lashdip, increasingly available in salons, coats the lashes and gives the appearance of wearing mascara for several weeks. It appears to be far safer than dyeing lashes.
- Cleansing
    - If you’re wearing mascara and eye makeup, wipe that off first with an eye makeup removal product.
    - Take a cotton pad and moisten it with toner or a tiny bit of water and a dab of cleanser.         - Make sure to remove all makeup, especially in areas where it tends to collect, such as above and in the eyebrows and in the creases around the nose and mouth.       
    - Once makeup is off, proceed to cleansing.
- Skin around the eyes
    - The skin in the eye area is very delicate and needs specially formulated products. 
    - Use only creams and serums that specifically say they have been ophthalmologically tested, and by all means **avoid eye creams with fragrances**, which can irritate the skin and cause swelling. - 
    - Be careful when applying creams and serums around the eyes. Pat gently onto the under-eye area and just below the brow, but never put any on the eyelid itself. Eyelid skin is so thin that the ingredients in products can actually penetrate to the eyeball beneath.

 - Dark under-eye circles 
    they can be treated very successfully with prescription topical creams (containing tretinoin or hydroquinone) and lasers. 
    Over-the-counter products with retinol and caffeine can also be helpful. 
    Vitamin K products are useless—don’t waste your money.
- Milia: little white bumps some people get under the eyes
    If small, they can be dissolved with an electric needle, but large ones have to be cut out. 
    Do not use heavy creams around the eyes, because they can make milia worse
- Toner is faster and more efficient than cleanser, but
    - A surprising number of people should stay away from toners. If you have **[[Eczema]] or rosacea**, even a salicylic acid toner is not a good idea because it can be too much for sensitive or reactive skin. People with **super-dry skin shouldn’t use toners,** either. 
    - Toners do have their uses, though, especially for oily, combination, normal, or acne-prone skin. If your skin is oily or prone to acne, tone twice a day (morning and night). 
        Telltale sign is the four o’clock shiny nose; if that’s what yours looks like in the afternoon, you should tone twice a day. If you have normal or combination skin, tone only once daily. If you have sensitive skin and have a hard time finding a toner you can tolerate, but you still want the benefits, here’s a tip: Gently wipe some over your face and then immediately rinse it off with cool water. This also works in winter when skin is drier.
    - Just be careful not to go at your face as if you were scrubbing a frying pan. A toner or pad is meant to be wiped gently over the face once—that’s it. Two toners that work well are L’Oréal Pure Zone Continuous Action and Clinique Mild Clarifying Lotion. For oily and acne-prone skin, La Roche-Posay Effaclar K is very effective. In my practice we make our own exfoliating pads, but Trish McEvoy’s Even Skin Beta Hydroxy Pads work well, too. Stridex Maximum Strength Pads have 2 percent salicylic acid, which is effective on oily skin with blocked pores.
- If you’re really too exhausted to wash your face with water and cleanser, at least have cleansing pads by your bed and use them to wipe makeup off.

- Exfoliate on a daily basis with your cotton washcloth or a disposable cotton pad and a cleanser, or with the use of the Clarisonic machine.

- In the morning
    Cleanse your face before you put on toner (if you need it) and then apply moisturizer or sunscreen. 
    Even if you cleansed and removed all makeup the night before, a splash of water in the morning or standing under the shower is not enough. During the night, as you sleep, bacteria build up on your skin, along with a lot of unwanted oil. 
    Cleanse your face with a product suitable for your skin type, and then pat dry your face gently but thoroughly. Towel should be clean, strictly for your personal use, and changed regularly. 
- In the evening
    same thing all over again
    +apply a serum or antiaging cream afterward

- If your skin is oily or acne prone
    - you may not need a moisturizer, especially in warm weather. Use a lightweight sunscreen lotion or powder instead. 
    - Some sunscreen lotions are designed to provide a matte finish for oily or combination skin

        Colorescience Sunforgettable Mineral Powder Brush SPF 30 or SPF 50 comes in a self-dispensing brush. 
    - normal or oily skin: in addition to your daily exfoliation, once or twice a week use something stronger, like a scrub with fine granules or microspheres, such as **Avène Gentle Exfoliating Scrub**. 
        If you don’t want to use abrasive scrubs, toners and pads with alpha-hydroxy acids or salicylic acid work well, too
    
- Sunscreens 
    2 general types: chemical and physical
        - Chemical sunscreens are effective, but some people are allergic to the main ingredients. 
        - If you do opt for a chemical sunscreen, look for one that contains avobenzone (Parsol 1789) or Mexoryl. 
        - In Europe, Tinosorb is a widely used ingredient that seems to do an excellent job, but it has yet to be approved for use in the United States.

        - Physical sunscreens that contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. They block more of the spectrum and have less potential to cause an allergic reaction. For people with **rosacea** or sensitive skin, physical sunscreens have an added benefit: Zinc oxide soothes irritation (that’s why it’s used on babies with diaper rash) and reduces redness. Same thing goes for people with **eczema**. Most moisturizers now have a good degree of sun protection. One of my favorites is Vanicream Sensitive Skin SPF 30, which is gentle enough to use on babies, although adults may find it a little oily. For acne-prone skin, Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 or Neova Z-Silc SPF 30 are very good alternatives. 
        - Remember, look for a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 30, even if you’re going to be sitting in an office or a classroom. Keep in mind that UVA rays penetrate glass, so your skin can be damaged even when you’re sitting near a window or driving a car.
        - Sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide require a lot of rubbing to prevent a whitish cast. As it turns out, though, this is the property that makes these products safe to use: They appear white because the particles of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are too big for the skin to absorb.
        - In sunscreens, particle size matters, not just for sun protection but for your overall health as well.
        - This is one area where big is truly better. When sunscreens go on white, it means that they contain micronized zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. When they come out clear from the tube, the manufacturer has used nanoparticles that are many times smaller. And scientists are growing increasingly concerned about nanoparticles and their possible effects. Recent studies have shown that people whose sunscreens contain zinc nanoparticles have increased levels of zinc in their blood. This is not the case for micronized particles, which, as far as research shows, seem to be too big to penetrate the surface of the skin; in other words, they just sit there and physically block the sun’s rays. “Some countries now force manufacturers to disclose the use of nanoparticles on sunscreen labels, but the United States is not yet one of them.
        - It has been my experience that sunscreens lose potency over time and even more quickly if they are left in bright sunlight. This is especially true of chemical sunscreens that contain avobenzone (Parsol 1789). So don’t leave your sunscreen out on the sand; put it back in your bag. 
- One ingredient that should not be in sunscreen (but frequently is) is **retinyl palmitate, a vitamin A derivative that is closely related to retinol.** Like retinol, retinyl palmitate is safe and effective in night creams—no surprise there, since retinyl palmitate is converted to retinol on your skin. The problem lies in retinol’s ability to increase cell turnover, which is exactly what you want at night. **But you don’t want this during the day, because those new skin cells are very sensitive and easily damaged.**
- Retinyl palmitate breaks down in sunlight to form free radicals that can harm cells and possibly lead to cancer. 
- Buy one of the many good sunscreens that do not list retinyl palmitate among their ingredients.
- Athletic people may be in better shape than the rest of us, but they also tend to have more sun damage if they haven’t taken appropriate precautions. 
- In the mountains, particularly on ski slopes, sunscreen is essential.

    Don’t forget the tips of your ears, the back of your neck, and where your hair parts, because these areas are vulnerable to skin cancer. If you don’t want to spray sunscreen on your hair or scalp, wear a hat instead. 
- For sports, the beach, and the mountains, look for sunscreens with a high SPF 
    Aveeno Continuous Protection Sunblock Spray SPF 50
    Mustela High Sun Protection Lotion SPF 50 
    Vanicream SPF 30. 
- Remember, even if the sunscreen is water-resistant, you will still need to reapply it every time you come out of the water.
## The Cleanser
The right cleanser can make a big difference; after all, it’s something you use twice a day (or should). People are often using the wrong cleanser. 

>**For dry, sensitive, or normal skin, buy a cleanser that is mild and won’t strip the natural oils.** 
- **Neutrogena Extra Gentle Clean** is fragrance-free, nondrying, and noncomedogenic (it won’t clog pores)
- **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** has ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which prevent skin from drying out
- **Basis Sensitive Skin Bar or Cetaphil** is a cleansing bar. 
- **Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.**  
>**For oily or acne-prone skin, an exfoliating cleanser will help to remove dead skin cells and bacteria.** 
- **RoC Multi Correxion Exfoliating Cleanser** 
- **L’Oréal Paris Go 360 Clean Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser** contains salicylic acid. 
    Although most of the salicylic acid will be washed down the drain, it does help to remove surface skin and excess oil.

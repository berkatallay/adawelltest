Humming in #meditation is one of the ways to stimulate the [[Vagus nerve]] that sends a message to the brain saying that everything is fine.

>Humming is one of the simplest and yet most profound sounds you can make. If you have a voice and can speak, you can hum. — Jonathan Goldman.  

It's much more than just a vocal technique, it's an exercise that helps to warm-up, cool down and improve/empower your voice.  

### Humming helps to:  
❥ Calm your nervous system in a natural way by stimulating the #vagusnerve which activates the parasympathetic nervous system (aka rest & digest response).  
❥ Reconnect you to your body and bring you back to the present moment, just by listening to your own voice and feeling the vibrations in your body when you make sound/vocalize.  
❥ Reduce stress and improve your health in many ways (such as reducing cortisol levels and inflammation, soothing pain & improving your immunity and mood).  
❥ Release tension in your throat and the rest of your body by ‘massaging’ yourself from within through the vibration of your vocal folds (aka vocal cords).  
### How to do it 
❥ Place your lips loosely together  
❥ Let your tongue relax on the floor of your mouth, gently touching the back of your bottom teeth  
❥ Relax your jaw  
❥ Release any tension in your shoulders  
❥ Take a few slow, deep breaths and start humming  
❥ Hum for 5 minutes (or more) at a comfortable pitch and focus on the vibrations (a buzzing sensation) in your face/head, throat and the rest of your body.

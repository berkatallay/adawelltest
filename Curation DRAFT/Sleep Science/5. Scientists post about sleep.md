You don’t need to travel to be jet lagged and suffer the health effects.</p>&mdash; Andrew D.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You don’t have to be neurotically attached to doing things at the exact same time every day but trying to get them done within a +/- 1 hour window will change everything for the better and provide resilience to your circadian system when you can’t. The body &amp; mind love schedules.</p>&mdash; Andrew D.

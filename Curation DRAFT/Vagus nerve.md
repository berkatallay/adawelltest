Vagus nerve is the most important and at the same time the longest nerve in the parasympathetic nervous system. The vagus nerve transmits a huge amount of information. It practically regulates the function of all internal organs, including the function of muscles associated with speaking and eating.  

Vagus nerve regulates heart rate, bowel movements, sweating, speech production, eating, and many other essential functions. Circulatory nerve dysfunction can cause problems with digestion (dyspepsia, reflux, colitis, etc.), glycemic control, urinary excretion, and immune function.  
  
Over the past couple of decades, vagus nerve imbalances associated with circulatory nerve dysfunction have been successfully treated with manual or electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. However, the vagus nerve can also be activated at home with easy methods.  For example, try:  

>Cold exposure
>Laughing
>Singing

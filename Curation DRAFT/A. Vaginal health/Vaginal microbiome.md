A microbiome is a community of bacteria and microbes
These microbiomes can be found in our mouths [[B. Oral microbiome]], our guts [[Gut microbiome]] and of course, our vaginas [[Vaginal microbiome]]

In a healthy, balanced vagina, there’s typically a high proportion of _Lactobacillus_species—organisms with names like _Lactobacillus crispatus,_ _Lactobacillus iners_, _Lactobacillus gasseri,_ and hundreds more. 
_Lactobacillus_ bacteria produce acidic compounds, like lactic acid, as part of their day-to-day routine. 
These keep the pH of your vagina relatively low, meaning your vagina is acidic. This acidity provides one of your first lines of defence against invading microbes that could cause infection and inflammation: microbes like _Staphylococcus aureus_ (commonly known as ‘staph’), _E. coli_, and group B strep. The same goes for fending off bacteria and viruses that can cause sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and more. Research even shows that a balanced and acidic vaginal microbiome decreases your chances of contracting or transmitting HIV.

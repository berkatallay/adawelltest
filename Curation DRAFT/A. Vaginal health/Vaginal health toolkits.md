- Avoiding douching, scented soaps and menstrual products, and other scented or flavored items that spend a lot of up close and personal time with your vagina. 

- Practicing safe sex with condoms, dental dams, etc. is also essential to reducing microbiome disturbance, as is using sex products (like lube, toys, and more) that are gentle, body safe, and easy on _your_ personal ecosystem. 

***Note:*** There’s no one-size fits all solution, because everybody’s microbiome is unique to them!

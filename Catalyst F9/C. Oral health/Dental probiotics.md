# **Oral/dental probiotics**
Oral health is heavily influenced by the [[B. Oral microbiome]]. 
###### **Note:** the bacterial strains often used to promote gut health are not the same ones that have been shown to improve oral health. 
The bacteria that colonize the mouth and gut are distinct, though research has shown that bacteria of the mouth can translocate to the gut and cause inflammation. 

#### Oral/dental probiotics 
- have been researched through dozens of clinical trials, which have demonstrated the efficacy of oral bacterial species in reducing **halitosis, symptoms of gum disease, and cavities.**
- some of these dental probiotics have been shown to reduce the risk of **cavities, permanently reduce bad breath, and reduce symptoms and progression of gum disease**. However, many oral probiotic strains are still being investigated, with only preliminary research demonstrating little to no efficacy. Not all dental probiotics have the same strains of bacteria that have been shown to work.
#### Oral probiotics for bad breath
The strains that have been shown to be most effective at reducing bad breath are:
    - Streptococcus salivarius K12 and M18
    - Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938
    - ATCC PTA 5289
However, for people with high levels of _S. salivarius_ in their microbiome, _S. salivarius_ K12 and M18 may be unable to colonize and improve bad breath.\
#### Oral probiotics for gum disease
The strains that have been shown to improve gum inflammation are:
    L. reuteri DSM 17938
    ATCC PTA 5289. 
In clinical trials, these strains have demonstrated an improvement by reducing plaque at the gums, reducing bleeding, and reducing pocket depth.
#### Oral probiotics for cavities
>Lactobacillus paracasei SD1 has been shown to reduce the progression of cavities, and may improve remineralization of incipient caries. 
>L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 may reduce the incidence of cavities in children, but little evidence to date exists to support their use in cavities prevention for adults.

These probiotics may have more beneficial effects in cases for people with high abundance of _Streptococcus mutans_. Research is still being done to determine their effects on other bacterial species like _Streptococcus sobrinus_ or _Scardovia wiggsiae.

## Melatonin
-   a hormone that ***the body creates to facilitate sleep***
-   a sleep hormone that ***your brain produces in response to darkness***
-   a [natural hormone3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705578/) that is produced by the pineal gland in the brain and then released into the bloodstream

-   It helps with the timing of circadian rhythm and with sleep. 

**💊Melatonin supplements may help with certain conditions, such as jet lag, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder.**

*Excerp from [Why We Sleep:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)* about melatonin supplements:

💊Melatonin helps regulate the timing of when sleep occurs by systemically signaling darkness throughout the organism. (That’s why we say don’t get exposed to light at night as it blocks melatonin [production](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know)).  But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself: a mistaken assumption that many people hold. To make clear this distinction, think of sleep as the Olympic 100-meter race. Melatonin is the voice of the timing official that says “Runners, on your mark,” and then fires the starting pistol that triggers the race. **That timing official (melatonin) governs when the race (sleep) begins, but does not participate in the race.** In this analogy, the sprinters themselves are other brain regions and processes that actively generate sleep. Melatonin corrals these sleep-generating regions of the brain to the starting line of bedtime. **Melatonin simply provides the official instruction to commence the event of sleep but does not participate in the sleeping race itself.**

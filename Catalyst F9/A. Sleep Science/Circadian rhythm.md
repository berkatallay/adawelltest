# Circadian rhytm
The circadian rhythm is known as the **sleep-wake cycle** and it’s the most important one. Circadian rhythms are a 24-hour cycle that is part of the body’s internal clock, running in the background to carry out essential functions and processes. Different systems of the body follow circadian rhythms that are synchronized with a master clock in the brain. A master clock sometimes referred to as the circadian pacemaker, is found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This master clock is directly influenced by environmental cues, especially **light**, which is why circadian rhythms are tied to the cycle of day and night. At different times of the day, clock genes in the SCN send signals to regulate activity throughout the body. The SCN is highly sensitive to light, which serves as a critical external cue that influences the signals sent by the SCN to coordinate internal clocks in the body. Our circadian rhythm aligns our sleep and wakefulness with day and night to create a stable cycle of restorative rest that enables increased daytime activity. The circadian rhythm:

-   connected to metabolism and weight through the regulation of blood sugar and cholesterol;
-   influence mental health as well, including the risk of psychiatric illnesses like depression and bipolar disorder as well as the potential for neurodegenerative diseases like dementia;
-   have an important influence on the immune system as well as processes of DNA repair that are involved in preventing cancer.

_Just not to confuse,_ **_Biological clock ≠ Circadian rhythm._**

Biological clocks help regulate the timing of bodily processes, including circadian rhythms. A circadian rhythm is an effect of a biological clock, but not all biological clocks are circadian.

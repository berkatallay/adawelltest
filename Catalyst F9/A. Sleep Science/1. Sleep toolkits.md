## 1. Sleep Hygiene Checklists: good light, bad light, and bedding habits
While cues like exercise, social activity, and temperature, can affect the master clock, **light** is the most powerful influence on [[circadian rhythm]].
1. **Dim the lights**
    Dimming the lights before you go to bed can help stimulate [[melatonin]] production. Try to keep away from bright lights because they can hinder the production of melatonin, a hormone that the body creates to facilitate sleep. Dim the lights and turn off your cell phone‚Äôs sound and vibration modes if possible. Use dim red lights for night lights. Red light is less likely to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin.
    - Keep electronics out of the bedroom. Remove devices (TVs, computers, and smart phones) from the bedroom.
    - Have 30-60 minute pre-bed buffer time that is device-free. Turn off all devices and unplug from electronics. Artificial light exposure at night can interfere with circadian rhythm. Avoid looking at bright screens beginning 2 to 3 hours before bed. Cell phones, tablets, and laptops cause mental stimulation that is hard to shut off and also generates blue light that decreases [[melatonin]] production. 
    - If you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, consider wearing blue-blocking glasses or installing an app that filters the blue/green wavelength at night.** at night.
2.  **Daylight**
    -   Expose yourself to daylight, especially sunlight (one of the key drivers of circadian rhythms that can encourage quality sleep) during the day, which will boost your ability to sleep at night.
    -   Within 30 minutes of waking up, open curtains, go outside and view sunlight (get sunlight till 9 a.m.üåÖ) and grou
3.  **Right bedding. Temperature. Sound.** 
    *Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature.* 
    - Use heavy curtains, or/and an eye mask to prevent light
    - Sleep in a cold room. Ensure a comfortable temperature, fine-tune your [bedroom temperature](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep) to suit your preferences, but on the cooler side :D. Set your bedroom to drop to **65 degrees** at the time you intend to go to sleep.  
    - To successfully initiate sleep your core temperature needs to decrease by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit, according to [Walker](https://twitter.com/sleepdiplomat). Set a cool yet comfortable temperature. Choose near floor beds. Sleeping closer to the ground means that you will stay naturally cooler. This can prove very useful during the warm summer months. This is because near floor sleeping helps you to relax. Feeling too hot or cold can disrupt sleep. Acquire ergonomic pillows and a high-quality mattress and climate control mattress pad helps you stay asleep and are critical for comfort and pain-free sleep. 
    - Use silk pillowcase. A recent clinical trial showed a reduction in pimples for people who snoozed on ‚Äúsilk-like‚Äù pillowcases when compared to those who slept on cotton covers.
    -  The sheets and blankets are the first things you touch when you get into bed, so it‚Äôs beneficial to make sure they match your needs and preferences.
    -  Drown Out Noise. Ear plugs can stop noise from keeping you awake, and if you don‚Äôt find them comfortable, you can try a white noise machine or even a fan to drown out bothersome sounds.
4.  **Winding down 30-60 min before bedtime.** **Get the right mindset for bed. Time.**
    -   Sleep naked.
    -   Schedule before-bed activities to signal that you are winding down, such as changing into pajamas and brushing your teeth.
    -   Read a book.
    -   Listen to relaxing music.
    -   Do some light stretching.
        Be Physically Active: Regular exercise can make it **[easier to sleep at night](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep)** and also delivers a host of other health benefits. Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.
    -   Try to exercise at some point in the day but avoid vigorous activity (running, fast dancing, high-intensity interval training, or HIIT) one hour before bedtime. Regular exercise of adequate intensity can promote muscle relaxation and deeper sleep later on.
    - **Practice** **[[NSDR]]****, (Non Sleep Deep Rest)
       Specific techniques to reach self-directed states of calm through mental focus. 
    -   Build a link in your mind between sleep and being in bed, it‚Äôs best to only use your bed only for sleep with sex being the one exception. Don‚Äôt Toss and Turn: It helps to have a healthy mental connection between being in bed and actually being asleep. For that reason, if after 20 minutes you haven‚Äôt gotten to sleep, get up and stretch, read, or do something else calming in low light before trying to fall asleep again.
    -  If you awaken and can‚Äôt return to sleep, don‚Äôt stay in bed. Get up and do quiet relaxing activities, such as reading, until you feel tired enough to fall back asleep.
    -  Meditation, mantras, and aphorisms sleep yoga, soft music (hz music, hang drum, acquire a sound machine, light stretching, reading, relaxation exercises
    -   mantras and aphorisms, sleep yoga, soft music, light stretching, reading, relaxation exercises 
    - Create calming bedtime rituals such as practicing deep breathing exercises, doing light yoga stretches, or listening to soothing relaxing music. Many meditation podcasts, apps, and YouTube videos offer these tools for free.
    -  Alarm clock only to remind you of going to sleep.
    -   Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends    
    -   Try to go to bed at night and awaken in the morning around the same time, even on weekends. This helps to regulate the body‚Äôs sleep cycles and circadian rhythms.
    -   Prioritize Sleep:** Calculate a target bedtime based on your fixed wake-up time and do your best to be ready for bed around that time each night.
    -   Make Gradual Adjustments: If you want to shift your sleep times, don‚Äôt try to do it all in one fell swoop because that can throw your schedule out of whack.
    -   Keep Your Routine Consistent: Following the same steps each night, including things like putting on your pajamas and brushing your teeth, can reinforce in your mind that it‚Äôs bedtime.
5.  **Food**
    *Avoid large meals, heavy snacking, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime.*
    - Limit alcohol, because alcohol is not a sleep aid, contrary to popular belief. While it might help induce sleep, ‚Äúalcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep,‚Äù Walker says.
    -  Caffeine. ¬†Cut Down on Caffeine in the Afternoon and Evening: Because it‚Äôs a stimulant, **[caffeine](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/caffeine-and-sleep)** can keep you wired even when you want to rest, so try to avoid it later in the day. Also be aware if you‚Äôre consuming lots of caffeine to try to make up for lack of sleep.
    -   Reduce Alcohol Consumption: **[Alcohol](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/alcohol-and-sleep)** may make it easier to fall asleep, but the effect wears off, disrupting sleep later in the night. As a result, it‚Äôs best to moderate alcohol consumption and avoid it later in the evening.
6.  **Nap**
    -  If you can possibly take a short midday nap like our ancestors used to and some Mediterranean and South American cultures still do, you should **(but no later than 3 pm)**. It will likely improve your creativity and coronary health as well as extend your lifetime. 
    - Keep naps short and early in the afternoon.
    - Nap: not more than 20-25 mins. 
    - Late and long naps can push back your bedtime and throw your sleep schedule off-kilter.

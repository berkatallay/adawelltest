## Stages of sleep:

-   **Light Sleep:** As your brain slows down, low-amplitude mixed-frequency (LAMF) activity replaces the alpha brain waves that took over as you became drowsy. Your body has some muscle tone, and your breathing is regular.
    
-   **Light Sleep:** Your heart rate and body temperature both decrease. [**Sleep spindles**](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-spindles) and K-complexes, specific brain wave patterns, begin occurring as you continue transitioning toward deep sleep.
    
-   **[[Deep sleep]]:** Your brain waves at this stage, called delta waves, are at their slowest of the night. Waking you is difficult, and those who are roused from this stage experience [**sleep inertia**](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-inertia), a short period of fogginess, and impaired cognitive performance. In deep sleep, your body physically repairs itself, boosting your immune system and restoring your bones, muscles, and tissue.
    
-   **REM Sleep**    

#### **REM sleep**

In this stage of sleep, your brain activity looks similar to how it looks when you are awake. You experience a loss of muscle tone, except for your eyes, which move rapidly. Your breathing becomes irregular and your heart rate rises. You experience your first cycle of REM sleep about [**60 to 90 minutes**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30285349/) after falling asleep. As part of a full nightâ€™s sleep, you cycle through four [**stages of sleep**](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep) multiple times: three stages of non-REM sleep, followed by [**one stage of REM sleep**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30252388/). Each cycle through all the sleep stages takes 90 to 120 minutes to complete. With each new cycle, you spend increasing amounts of time in REM sleep, with most of your REM sleep taking place in the second half of the night.

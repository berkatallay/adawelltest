## **Problem 1 - Wellbeing resources are not reliable**

Instead of using specialized websites most people use general search engines when looking for health information. There are portals that monetize user attention (via ads, sponsorships) under the wellbeing content. Read, [GOOP: What a Mess](https://anesthesiaexperts.com/uncategorized/goop-mess/). Some may even contain false medical information that misleads consumers into purchasing "snake oil" medical treatments.  

## **Problem 2 - Health-care today: necessary but not sufficient**

Modern medicine waits for a disease to arise before optimizing treatments. The medical system will always need to attend to patients in need of lifesaving treatments. A complementary focus and holistic approach however will improve quality of life.

  

This excerpt from [True Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58735037-true-age) by Morgan Levine, PhD exemplifies the problem:

‘’Take our health care system’s present approach to diabetes as an example. While many people will have their fasting blood sugar (HbA1c) measured during routine physicals, there is often no discussion about disease prevention until a person is diagnosed with borderline diabetes. Usually, if you are below the cutoff, your doctor will say, **“Your blood sugar looks good!”** But aside from offering reassurance, physicians should also be actively helping their patients keep their levels as far as possible from the magic lines that differentiate nondiabetic from borderline and diabetic.’’

  

## **Problem 3 - More content, less time**

Science popularization is on the rise as it has never been before. But, not everyone has time or interest to read medical journals and magazines, listen to 2-3 hour long podcasts, or consume other kinds of science materials. 

  

## **ADAwell is the platform that tackles these problems.** 
The full vision of ADAwell make all three functions it has to operate:

-   **Function 1 - Curation & Synthesis (Performing function in this proposal)**
-   Function 2 - Events & Challenges (Performing in the future)
-   Function 3 - Support (Performing in the future)

This proposal is the proof of concept for ADAwell. It aims to implement a part of Function 1 - Curation & Synthesis, and kickstart the ADAwell community and DAO. Other functions will be implemented in the future, with a larger team.

### **Curation & Synthesis kickstarts the ADAwell platform.** 

The platform provides curated and synthesized health information in three formats:

-   **Toolkits** are useful, applicable tools (checklists, protocols, tips) that help you optimize your health and wellbeing. (Example: Eye Health Toolkit)
-   **Education/Health literacy** is curated and up-to-date health resources/databases from fields like human biology, anatomy, longevity and geroscience. In this format, we provide up-to-date knowledge that not only can help prevent diseases but to optimize health, and there is always room for improvement when it comes to maximizing our biological health. This curation will be as short as possible giving the main idea with the sources. See some examples from [podcastnotes.org](https://podcastnotes.org/), [longevity insider](https://subscribe.longevityinsider.org/subscribe/landing-1-a/?referrer=https://www.google.com.tr/)
-   **Community Requests.** This format allows the Cardano community to request a curation for a specific topic. The aim is to provide mechanisms for the needed knowledge in real-time to the community. 

#### **How do we Curate & Synthesize**

-   curate materials from trusted sources, bring together, organize and structure in a useful way;
-   synthesize documents, combine, summarize, and remove any possible duplications and contradictions;
-   update knowledge in the platform constantly;
-   validate by an expert or a community of practice.

  

#### **More about Toolkits**

Toolkit’s goals vary from maximizing mental health to helping prevent diseases. Here are some examples:

  

**1 - Preventive Health:** Making screenings and treatments a priority, you are taking the necessary steps toward living a healthier life. Of course, you can Google screening and find information about the necessary examinations you need to take. However, as health optimization ADAwell’s number one priority we won’t only provide necessary screening Toolkits but additional Toolkits that will consider more specific situations and provide detailed plans. With Curation and Synthesis>Toolkits>Preventive health you can decide and answer to such questions below:

-   Ex: You need to have X screening, but what if you are pregnant atm.
-   In X case, an appointment with a doc should be made every X months/days. Ex: you have a gum disease: see your periodontist every X months/days, or do X procedure in X/every X days.
-   You have dry eyes, you may have the Sjongren’s syndrome or it’s just caused by long screen times. 

  

**2 - How to** read labels, keep personal health records, communicate with your doctor, listen to your body signals, etc.

  

**3 - When and How (Protocols)** will help you with diet optimization. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/adalatraimova/status/1445420541310128128?s=20&t=J1jRF2Jcw3x7Ws2lIXM4yA) related to this.

-   _Foods to eat/not eat at the same meal._ (Why eating fish and dairy together at the same meal is toxic?)
-   _Cooking techniques._ (Why is broccoli subjected to different cooking techniques, and what is the optimal technique?)
-   _Foods to avoid before/after X event._ (Foods to eat/not eat before/after x procedure)
-   Glucose management, sugar crash prevention.
-   [Jessie Inchauspé’s](https://www.glucosegoddess.com/) work is a perfect example of this.
-   Nutrient/Intestinal absorption (movement of nutrients from the small intestine into the blood supply)
-   _The best time to take ‘‘X’’ supplement._ (Ex: Probiotic Supplement. First thing in the morning, optimal before eating when the gut has been "rested" overnight and there is less gut fermentation going on.)
-   _Supplement-Supplement interaction._ (B1+B12=allergic reaction, or don't combine Vit-D with Vit-C, A, or E; the reason is explained, reliable source is provided)
-   _Food-Supplement interaction._ (Strawberry+iron supplement=increases absorption of iron)
-   _Food-Food interaction._ (Coffee after steak=coffee and other caffeinated drinks can reduce iron absorption.)
-   _Food-Medication interaction. Prevent/reduce/control side effects of the medicine._ (Harmful interactions: alcohol, nicotine, caffeine. Don't smoke cigarettes while you are taking oral contraceptives, or don’t mix alcohol with certain medications)

  

#### **Community building** 

ADAwell is designed to be a community driven effort. With this proposal, we start the ADAwell community with a Discord server. We are in contact with wellbeing and medical experts. We will invite these individuals to become members to kickstart the community, share the knowledge we generate in Curation & Synthesis through Twitter, Instagram, and in the Catalyst community to expand the community.

The aim at this stage is to gather like minded individuals with a passion for science communication and wellbeing. From there, we build a core team who wants to be a part of the ADAwell mission and implement the other mentioned functions. 

  

#### **From community to Cardano DAO**

ADAwell aims to become a Cardano DAO. The tooling needed for DAOs is lacking at the moment, but is in development. As part of the proposal, we will investigate existing solutions with the help of Littlefish Foundation’s [Tech Help Collective](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Colonies/Tech+Help+Collective/Tech+Help+Collective), and strategize on how to transform ADAwell into a community driven wellness DAO on Cardano. 

  

#### **Outcomes:** 

-   Implement part of Function 1: ‘‘Curation & Synthesis’’ (Details in plan section)
-   Curated Toolkits & Health literacy contents.
-   Start the ADAwell wellbeing community on Discord
